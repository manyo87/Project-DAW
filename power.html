            <h2>Power Metal</h2>
            <p>
                Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed
                metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and
                more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent, for example, in extreme
                metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong
                choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound.

                Anthropologist Sam Dunn traced the origins of power metal back to the late 1970s, when the groundwork
                for power metal lyrical style was laid down by Ronnie James Dio. The fantasy-oriented lyrics he wrote
                for Rainbow, concentrated around medieval, renaissance, folk, and science fiction themes, directly
                influenced modern power metal bands. In his 2011 documentary series Metal Evolution, Dunn further
                explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery. His almost
                constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal. The twin-guitar
                sound promoted by Judas Priest's duo of K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton also highly influenced this
                subgenre. Another pioneer in the power metal genre is Jon Mikl Thor, who was a strong inspiration to the
                American band Manowar.

                Another British band, Iron Maiden, brought epic and melodic sensibility to metal, creating anthemic,
                singalong music, an approach widely embraced by modern power metal musicians. The emergence of the early
                German power-metal scene in particular was made possible by Scorpions and Accept. Swedish guitarist
                Yngwie Malmsteen made a significant impact on many future power metal guitarists, with his accurate and
                fast neo-classical style. His bandmate Jens Johansson modernized the keyboard sound of Deep Purple's Jon
                Lord, which was further incorporated into the genre. Manowar's mythological sword and sorcery lyrics
                influenced a number of power metal bands.

                Throughout the early 1980s especially in the years 1982 and 1983, a US power metal style first emerged
                from traditional heavy metal, the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM), and thrash/speed metal
                influences. The exact first origin is often contested, but bands such as Cirith Ungol, Jag Panzer,
                Manilla Road, Omen, Riot, Savatage, and Warlord are thought to have influenced the earliest development
                of the style.

            <p>More concretely, in 1987 German band Helloween released their second album, Keeper of the Seven Keys:
                Part I, cited by AllMusic as "a landmark recording that remains arguably the single most influential
                power metal album to date. Its volatile combination of power and melody would inspire an entire
                generation of metal bands". This release influenced a European power metal style to evolve, which
                proliferated throughout the globe and since the start of the 1990s is still the most commonly heard
                style of power metal.</p>
