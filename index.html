                <p>
                    Heavy metal is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the
                United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock, heavy
                metal bands developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by distortion, extended guitar solos,
                emphatic beats, and loudness.

                    In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple, were
                founded.
                Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon
                followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "metalheads" or
                "headbangers".

                    During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe. Underground
                scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands
                such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and
                black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the
                definition of the genre.
